Problem: Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.

Example:
Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Input: "hello"
Output: False

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can compare the given string with its reversed version. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not a palindrome.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
```

In this solution, we first remove any whitespace in the input string and convert it to lowercase to handle case insensitivity. Then, we compare the string with its reversed version using slicing `s[::-1]`. If they are equal, we return True indicating that the string is a palindrome.
