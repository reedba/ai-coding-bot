Sure, I can help with that! 

Problem: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

For example, "racecar" and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" are both palindromes.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()  # remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # False
```

Explanation:
1. In the solution, we first remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase using `join()` and `lower()` methods.
2. We then check if the modified string is equal to its reverse (achieved by slicing the string with `[::-1]`).
3. If the modified string is equal to its reverse, then the original string is a palindrome and the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
