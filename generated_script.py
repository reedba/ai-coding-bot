Problem: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward).

Explanation: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. To determine if a string is a palindrome, we need to compare the string to its reverse.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()  # Convert string to lowercase to make comparison case-insensitive
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum())  # Remove non-alphanumeric characters
    
    return s == s[::-1]  # Compare original string with its reverse

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"))  # Output: True
```

In this solution, we first convert the input string to lowercase using `lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive. We then use a list comprehension to remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the string using `isalnum()`. Finally, we compare the modified string with its reverse using slicing `[::-1]` and return True if they are equal, indicating that the input string is a palindrome.
