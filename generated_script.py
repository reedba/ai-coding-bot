Problem:

Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. Ignore capitalization, spaces, and punctuation.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True
Explanation: The string "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome when ignoring capitalization, spaces, and punctuation.

Solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    s = ''.join(ch.lower() for ch in s if ch.isalnum())  # remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]  # check if the string is equal to its reverse

# Test the function with the example input
input_str = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(input_str))
```

In the solution, we first preprocess the input string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase. Then, we compare the processed string with its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome. Finally, we test the function with the example input and print the result.
