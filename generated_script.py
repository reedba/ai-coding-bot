Problem: 

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True

Explanation: The input string, when stripped of spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, reads the same backward as forward (amanaplanacanalpanama), therefore it is a palindrome.

Solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch.isalnum()).lower()  # remove spaces, punctuation, and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]  # check if the string is equal to its reverse

# Test the function with the provided example
input_string = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(input_string))  # Output: True
```

In this solution, we first remove spaces and punctuation from the input string and convert it to lowercase using list comprehension. Then, we check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse by comparing it to `s[::-1]`. If they are equal, the function returns True indicating that the input string is a palindrome.
