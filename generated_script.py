Problem: Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome.

Explanation: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "madam" and "racecar" are palindromes. We need to write a function that takes a string s as input and returns True if s is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove any non-alphanumeric characters
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test the function
s1 = "Madam"
s2 = "hello"
s3 = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"

print(is_palindrome(s1))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome(s2))  # Output: False
print(is_palindrome(s3))  # Output: True
```

This function first removes any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string and converts it to lowercase. Then, it checks if the modified string is equal to its reverse (achieved using slicing with a step of -1). If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the input string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False.
