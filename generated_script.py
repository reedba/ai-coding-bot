Problem:
Given two strings, s and t, determine if they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

Explanation:
To determine if two strings are anagrams, we can simply check if the sorted version of each string is the same. If the sorted version of both strings is the same, then the strings are anagrams of each other.

Solution (in Python):
```python
def isAnagram(s, t):
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

# Test cases
s1 = "listen"
t1 = "silent"
print(isAnagram(s1, t1))  # Output: True

s2 = "abc"
t2 = "def"
print(isAnagram(s2, t2))  # Output: False
```

In the above solution, we define a function `isAnagram` that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams, and False otherwise. We then test the function with two sets of strings to demonstrate its correctness.
