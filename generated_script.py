Problem: 

Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters which reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True

Explanation:
Removing spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, the string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama", which is a palindrome.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join([c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum()]) # Remove spaces, punctuation and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1] # Check if the string is equal to its reverse

# Test the function
input_string = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(input_string)) # Output: True
```

In the solution above, we first remove all spaces and punctuation from the input string and convert the characters to lowercase. We then check if the modified string is equal to its reverse using string slicing. If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the input string is a palindrome.
