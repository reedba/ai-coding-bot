Sure, I can help with that!

Problem:
Given a string, write a Python function to reverse the order of words in the string. For example, if the input string is "hello world", the output should be "world hello".

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Split the input string into a list of words using the split() method.
2. Reverse the list of words using the reverse() method.
3. Join the reversed list of words back into a string using the join() method.

Solution in Python:
```python
def reverse_words(input_string):
    words = input_string.split()
    words.reverse()
    reversed_string = ' '.join(words)
    return reversed_string

# Test the function
input_string = "hello world"
output_string = reverse_words(input_string)
print(output_string)  # Output: world hello
```

You can try running this code with different input strings to test the function. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to explain anything further!
