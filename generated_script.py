Problem: 
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. 

Example:
Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Input: "hello"
Output: False

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can compare the original string with its reverse. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome. We can use Python's slicing technique to reverse the string.

Solution in Python:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
```

In this solution, the `[::-1]` slicing syntax reverses the given string `s`. Then we compare the reversed string with the original string using the `==` operator to determine if it is a palindrome or not.
