Sure! Here's a DSA problem related to strings and arrays:

Problem:
Given a string, write a Python function to check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards. The function should return True if the given string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can compare the original string with its reverse. If the reversed string is the same as the original string, then the given string is a palindrome.

Solution in Python:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar")) # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))   # Output: False
```

In the above solution, the `s[::-1]` notation is used to reverse the given string `s`. The function `is_palindrome` compares the original string `s` with its reverse, and returns True or False based on the comparison.
