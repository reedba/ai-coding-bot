Problem: 
Given a string, write a Python function to check if it is a palindrome, ignoring any non-alphanumeric characters.

Explanation:
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. In this problem, we want to check if a given string is a palindrome after ignoring any non-alphanumeric characters (such as spaces, punctuation, etc.).

Solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
    clean_s = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    
    # Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse
    return clean_s == clean_s[::-1]

# Test the function with some inputs
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")) # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("race a car")) # Output: False
```

In this solution, we first clean the input string by converting it to lowercase and removing any non-alphanumeric characters using a list comprehension. Then, we check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse (using Python's string slicing). If the two are equal, we return True (indicating that the input string is a palindrome), otherwise we return False.
