Problem: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can compare the given string with its reverse. If the original string is equal to its reverse, then it is a palindrome.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Convert the string to lowercase and remove any non-alphanumeric characters
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Compare the string with its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test the function with some examples
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # Output: False
```

In this solution, we first remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the input string and convert it to lowercase using list comprehension. Then, we compare the modified string with its reverse using slicing (`s[::-1]`). If they are equal, we return True indicating that the string is a palindrome, otherwise we return False.
