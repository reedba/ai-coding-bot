Problem: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward).

Explanation:
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. To determine if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the original string to its reverse. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Remove spaces and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()
    
    # Compare original string to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]
    
# Test the function with some examples
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
print(is_palindrome("A man a plan a canal Panama"))  # Output: True
```

In this solution, we first remove spaces and convert the string to lowercase using the `replace()` and `lower()` functions. Then, we compare the original string `s` to its reverse `s[::-1]` using the equality operator `==`. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.
