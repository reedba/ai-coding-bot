Problem:
Given a string, return the most frequent character(s) in the string. If there are multiple characters that are equally common, return all of them.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. We will iterate through the string, updating the frequency of each character in the dictionary. Once we have the frequency of each character, we can find the maximum frequency and then iterate through the dictionary to find all characters that have this maximum frequency.

Solution:

```python
def most_frequent_character(s):
    char_freq = {}
    max_freq = 0
    for char in s:
        if char in char_freq:
            char_freq[char] += 1
        else:
            char_freq[char] = 1
        max_freq = max(max_freq, char_freq[char])
    
    most_frequent_chars = [char for char, freq in char_freq.items() if freq == max_freq]
    return most_frequent_chars

# Test the function
s = "hello world"
result = most_frequent_character(s)
print(result) # Output: ['l', 'o']
```

In this solution, we first iterate through the string `s` and update the frequency of each character in the `char_freq` dictionary. We also keep track of the maximum frequency in the variable `max_freq`. After iterating through the string, we iterate through the dictionary to find all characters that have frequency equal to `max_freq` and store them in the `most_frequent_chars` list. Finally, we return this list as the result.
