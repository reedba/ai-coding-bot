Problem: Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True (since the string reads the same backward as forward after ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization)

Explanation:
To check if a string is a palindrome, we can first remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert all characters to lowercase. Then, we can compare the string with its reversed version to see if they are equal.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum()).lower()
    
    # Compare the string with its reversed version
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test the function
input_string = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(input_string))  # Output: True
```

This solution will correctly identify whether a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
