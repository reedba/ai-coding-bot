Problem: 
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Return True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True

Explanation:
In this example, the input string "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower() # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1] # Check if the string is equal to its reverse

# Test the function
input_string = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(input_string)) # Output: True
```

In this solution, we first preprocess the input string by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase. Then, we check if the processed string is equal to its reverse by using slicing. If they are equal, we return True, otherwise False.
