Sure! Here is a problem for you to work on:

Problem:
Given a string s, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Example:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: True

Explanation:
In this example, the string s can be modified to "amanaplanacanalpanama" after removing spaces, punctuation, and converting all characters to lowercase. This modified string reads the same forward and backward, so the function should return True.

Solution in Python:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    return s == s[::-1]

s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
print(is_palindrome(s))  # Output: True
```

You can test this function with different input strings to see if it correctly identifies palindromes. Let me know if you have any questions or need further explanation!
