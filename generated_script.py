Problem:

Given a string, write a Python function to reverse the order of the words in the string.

Example:

Input: "hello world"
Output: "world hello"

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can first split the input string by spaces to get a list of words. Then, we can reverse the order of the words in the list and join them back together with spaces to form the final reversed string.

Solution:

```python
def reverse_string_words(s):
    words = s.split()  # Split the input string by spaces to get a list of words
    reversed_words = words[::-1]  # Reverse the order of the words in the list
    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)  # Join the reversed words with spaces to form the final reversed string
    return reversed_string

# Test the function with the example input
input_string = "hello world"
output_string = reverse_string_words(input_string)
print(output_string)  # Output: "world hello"
```

This function takes in a string as input, splits it into a list of words, reverses the order of the words, and then joins the reversed words back together to form the final reversed string.
