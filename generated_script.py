Problem: 
Given a string s, reverse the string word by word.

Explanation:
You need to write a function that takes a string s as input and reverses the order of the words in the string while keeping the words themselves in the same order. Words are defined as sequences of non-space characters separated by a space. You need to account for leading or trailing spaces and ensure that the words are separated by exactly one space in the reversed string.

Example:
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Solution:

```python
def reverseWords(s):
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()
    
    # Join the list of words with a space in between
    return ' '.join(words)

# Test the function with the given example
input_str = "the sky is blue"
output_str = reverseWords(input_str)
print(output_str) 
```

Output:
"blue is sky the"
