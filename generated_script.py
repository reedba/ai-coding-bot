Problem: 

Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for a palindrome.

Example:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True

Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Input: "hello world"
Output: False

Explanation:

To determine if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the string with its reverse. To ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, we can preprocess the string by converting it to lowercase and removing any non-alphanumeric characters.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Preprocess the string
    s = ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalnum())
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Compare the string with its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test the function
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello world"))  # Output: False
```

This function takes a string as input, preprocesses it by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase, and then compares the string with its reverse using slicing. If the string is equal to its reverse, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns False.
