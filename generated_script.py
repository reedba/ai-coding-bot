Problem: Given a list of strings, write a function that returns the longest common prefix of all the strings.

Explanation: The longest common prefix is the prefix that is shared among all the strings in the list. For example, if the list of strings is ["flower", "flow", "flight"], the longest common prefix is "fl".

Solution in Python:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Find the minimum length string in the list
    min_len_str = min(strs, key=len)
    
    # Loop through the characters of the minimum length string
    for i in range(len(min_len_str)):
        for j in range(len(strs)):
            # If the characters at index i of all strings do not match, return the prefix
            if strs[j][i] != min_len_str[i]:
                return min_len_str[:i]
    
    # If all characters match, return the minimum length string
    return min_len_str

# Test the function
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strings))  # Output: "fl"
```

This function finds the longest common prefix by checking the characters at each index of the minimum length string with the corresponding index of all other strings in the list. It returns the prefix when it encounters a character that does not match across all strings.
