Problem: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome (i.e. reads the same forwards and backwards).

Explanation:
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (excluding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). For example, "racecar" and "madam" are palindromes.

Solution in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower() # Convert string to lowercase for case-insensitivity
    s = ''.join(char for char in s if char.isalnum()) # Remove non-alphanumeric characters
    return s == s[::-1] # Check if the string is equal to its reverse

# Test cases
print(is_palindrome("racecar")) # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("madam")) # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello")) # Output: False
```

In the solution above, we first convert the input string to lowercase and remove any non-alphanumeric characters using a list comprehension. We then compare the cleaned string with its reverse using slicing. If the original string is equal to its reverse, then it is a palindrome and we return True. Otherwise, we return False. We test the function with some example strings to verify its correctness.
