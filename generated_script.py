Problem: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Input: A string s

Output: Return True if s is a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Example:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
Output: True (since the string reads the same forward and backward after ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization)

Solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()) # remove spaces, punctuation, and convert to lowercase
    return s == s[::-1]

# Test the function
s = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
print(is_palindrome(s)) # Output: True
```

Explanation: 
- The `is_palindrome` function takes a string `s` as input. It first removes any spaces and punctuation from the string and converts all characters to lowercase using a list comprehension and the `isalnum()` method to check if a character is alphanumeric.
- It then checks if the cleaned-up string is equal to its reverse using slicing (`[::-1]`). If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns False.
